Usage:

    apt install openvpn || yum install openvpn
    cd /etc/openvpn
    openvpn-instant-config --ssl joe fred harry
    systemctl enable openvpn@server
    systemctl start openvpn@server

That creates server.conf in tls-server mode, and {joe,fred,harry}.ovpn, which can work out of the
box on clients.
